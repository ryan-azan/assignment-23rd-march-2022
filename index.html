                <h2>Hrithik Roshan's Information</h2>
                <p align="justify"><strong>Hrithik Roshan</strong> , born on <em>10 January 1974</em>. is an Indian actor who works in Hindi films <strong>  He has portrayed a variety of characters and is known for his dancing skills.</strong>.  One of the highest-paid actors in India, he has won many awards, including six Filmfares, four for Best Actor and one each for Best Debut and Best Actor (Critics). Starting in 2012, he appeared several times in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 based on his income and popularity.</p>

                <p align="justify"><strong> Roshan has frequently collaborated with his father, Rakesh Roshan. He made brief appearances as a child actor in several films in the 1980s and later worked as an assistant director on four of his father's films. His first leading role was in the box-office success Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000), for which he received several awards. Performances in the 2000 terrorism drama Fiza and the 2001 ensemble melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... consolidated his reputation but were followed by several poorly received films.</strong></p>

                <p align="justify"><em><strong>The 2003 science fiction film Koi... Mil Gaya, for which Roshan won two Filmfare Awards, was a turning point in his film career; he also appeared in its sequels: Krrish (2006) and Krrish 3 (2013). He earned praise for his portrayal of a thief in Dhoom 2 (2006), Mughal emperor Akbar in Jodhaa Akbar (2008) and a quadriplegic in Guzaarish (2010). He achieved further commercial success by playing the lead in the 2011 drama Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, the 2012 revenge film Agneepath, the 2014 action comedy Bang Bang!, the 2019 biopic Super 30, and the 2019 action thriller War, which ranks as his highest-grossing release.</strong></em></p>

                <p align="justify">Roshan's grandfather, Prakash first brought him on-screen at the age of six in the film Aasha (1980); he danced in a song enacted by Jeetendra, for which Prakash paid him ₹100.[13][14] Roshan made uncredited appearances in various family film projects, including his father's production Aap Ke Deewane (1980). In Prakash's Aas Paas (1981), he appeared in the song "Shehar Main Charcha Hai".[15] The actor's only speaking role during this period came when he was 12; he was seen as Govinda, the title character's adopted son, in Prakash's Bhagwaan Dada (1986).[16][17] Roshan decided that he wanted to be a full-time actor, but his father insisted that he focus on his studies.[17] In his early 20s, he was diagnosed with scoliosis that would not allow him to dance or perform stunts. Initially devastated,[18][19] he eventually decided to become an actor anyway. Around a year after the diagnosis, he took a chance by jogging on a beach when he was caught in a downpour. There was no pain, and becoming more confident, he was able to increase his pace with no adverse effects. Roshan sees this day as "the turning point of [his] life."[18]</p>

                <p align="justify"> His father, film director Rakesh Roshan, is the son of music director Roshanlal Nagrath; his mother, Pinky, is the daughter of producer and director J. Om Prakash. His uncle, Rajesh, is a music composer.[2] Roshan has an older sister, Sunaina, and was educated at the Bombay Scottish School.[6] Roshan belongs to a Hindu family, though he considers himself more spiritual than religious.[7][8]</p>

                <p align="justify"> <strong><em> Roshan has also performed on stage and debuted on television with Just Dance (2011). As a judge on the latter, he became the highest-paid film star on Indian television. He is involved with a number of humanitarian causes, endorses several brands and products and has launched his own clothing line. Roshan was married for fourteen years to Sussanne Khan, with whom he has two children.</p>

                <p><i><small>On 20 December 2000, Roshan married Sussanne Khan in a private ceremony in Bangalore.</small></i><sup>[151]</sup>Despite their religious difference—Roshan is a Hindu and Khan is a Muslim—Roshan says that he equally valued her beliefs.<sup>[7]</sup> The couple has two sons, Hrehaan (born in 2006) and Hridhaan (born in 2008).[152][153] They separated in December 2013 and their divorce was finalised in November 2014.<sup>[151]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>Roshan and Sussanne maintained that they parted amicably.<sup>[154]</sup> In 2016, he filed a lawsuit against his Krrish 3 co-star Kangana Ranaut, accusing her of cyber stalking and harassment.<sup>[155]</sup> Denying the charges, Ranaut filed a counter-charge against Roshan, claiming that his lawsuit was an attempt to cover up their affair.<sup>[156]</sup> Owing to a lack of evidence, the Mumbai Police closed the case later that year.<sup>[157]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>Roshan considered quitting the film industry after two assailants fired bullets at his father in 2000.<sup>[27]</sup> Later that December, he was involved in a controversy when Nepalese newspapers accused him of stating in a Star Plus interview that he hated Nepal and its people. This led to protests in the country, a ban on screening of his films, and four people's deaths after street violence.<sup>[158]</sup> Nepalese people threatened to "bury [him] alive" if he ever visited the country.[159] Star Plus, for its part, stated that Roshan "did not touch upon Nepal." The violence calmed down after Roshan wrote a two-page rejoinder in which he denied having made any claim against the country. Nepali actress Manisha Koirala helped distribute it to newspapers and a local television station.<sup>[160]</sup>
